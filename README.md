# win-loss-obs-panel
It's just an interface for adding wins and losses. Very barebones, uses local storage in OBS. 

Tested with OBS 31.0.0-rc1, should theoretically work with most versions of OBS.

## How to set up
1. Add panel.html as a dock
  i. Docks -> Customer Browser Docks.. -> Add dock name + http://absolute/C:/"ENTER THE FILE URL HERE" -> Apply
2. Add overlay.html as a Browser Source, and adjust as needed
3. Should be good to go from there. (add screenshots for steps)

## Future plans
- resizes depending on the size of the browser source
- better panel visuals idk
